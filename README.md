# NeuralNetwork_TicTacToe

In the interest of learning more about machine learning and neural networks, I've decided to write a program that can teach itself to play Tic-Tac-Toe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe

Of course, the "game" (more of a solved puzzle) is simple enough that it would be fairly straightforward to describe the rules in code. However, I want to see whether I can get the program to discover said rules by itself.

Hopefully, this same simplicity will also make it easier to follow what the program is doing and how it makes its decisions.
